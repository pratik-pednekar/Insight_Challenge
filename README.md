# Consumer Complaints Code

Code developed by Pratik Pednekar for Insight Challenge to use Federal data on consumer complaints against companies regarding different financial products. 
The output of the code generates a csv file summarizing for all year and product:
1) The number of complaints
2) The number of companies complained about
3) The highest percentage of all companies towards a single company
